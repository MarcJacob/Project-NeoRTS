# Project-NeoRTS
Streamed Online RTS Project.

Link to current Client build : https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_UJcRmgkqBtBGLjMqTX6O8486oE9Dlb/view?usp=sharing

Note that the game isn't in a playable state : all present interactive elements are built as a test, using the Framework beneath as a service of sorts. 
Development was entirely streamed on my Twitch channel : https://www.twitch.tv/Hoshiqua
... and entirely uploaded to my Youtube channel : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvdyDp5GVFhEls_3hy7M38A

Becauses of changes to my stream schedule and format, development is for now suspended. Video presentation of the current codebase coming soon.
